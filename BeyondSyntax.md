## Realized practices

Designing is essential to how individuals express their work in art or science which leads to uniqueness in creativity. In coding, design can be crucial to the overall outcome of the code and its execution. Design patterns serve as handy templates that show how to organize code in a clear and efficient way. They make it easier to build software that works well, is easy to change, and doesn't get too messy. Junior programmers don't often realize design patterns being used, however, this makes a big difference in computer programming.

## Choose your pattern

There are various design patterns in programming. One useful technique in programming is the creational design pattern. This includes a set of methods to build the foundation of your software. The Singleton pattern, for example is a pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a way to access that instance from any part of the program.

Another type is the structural design pattern. This pattern organizes a layout efficiently, so you can smoothly use applications with different interfaces. It's like using an adapter for a different outlet, making sure incompatible parts can still work together. When you bring old systems into modern technology, the adapter pattern acts as the bridge between them.

Finally, behavioral design patterns are like rules that guide how teammates act during a game. The 'observer pattern' is a good example; it's like players following the coach's instructions. When one player moves or changes tactics, the observer pattern ensures others know and can adapt. This helps different parts of a system communicate well, especially in real-time situations where changes in one area affect others sort of like a team effort.

To sum up, design patterns are essential tools in software development, offering proven solutions to common challenges. By applying these patterns, developers can enhance code quality, maintainability, and scalability. Embracing design patterns fosters cleaner, more understandable code and promotes collaboration and innovation within development teams. Their importance in shaping the future of software development cannot be overstated.

## From Procedural to Object-Oriented 
Animal Farm is a semester-long project from EE 205. It consists of smaller projects that build upon each other and teach the basics of C and C++. As we moved away from procedural programming, object-oriented programming was introduced with Animal Farm. We learned to use tools like Git/GitHub, CLion IDE, and the command line to practice good software engineering habits. Upon the completion of each lab, it would then be pushed onto GitHub for documentation.

In the initial repository of the lab, the implementation began with simple data structure such as an arry. It also introduced the basics of C and C++. As we progressed further into the semester, we learned about classes, different data structures, and database functions that were implemented into Animal Farm. The different versions of Animal Farm are shown below which have a unique requirement.

- Animal Farm 0 - An array database of cats, where each attribute is an array
- Animal Farm 1 - The cat's attributes conveerted from arrays into structs
- Animal Farm 2 - Implementing a singly linked-list database of cats, where each cat is an object
- Animal Farm 3 - Implementing a collection class that implements a singly linked database of Animal objects with the following: An abstract list, a singly linked list, and a Node. In addition, we added an abstract Animal which inherits from Node and Mammal to the Cat object model.

In this project, I had the opportunity to create both a client and a server which required me to learn socket programming. The server, acting as a responsive entity, patiently awaits requests or commands. Upon receiving a request, it processes the request and promptly returns a thoughtful reply. The client is the counterpart in this dynamic interaction, responsible for initiating requests. As their names suggest, their functionality is much like a client and server at a restaurant where the client requests an item and the server sends the requested item back to the client. Below is a visual example of this dynamic.

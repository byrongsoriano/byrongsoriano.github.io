## JavaScript: Old and New
Prior to this course, I have had some exposure to JavaScript in my high school coding class. One of my assignments for that class was to create a functioning clock using JavaScript. Through learning JavaScript now in ICS 314, most of the content ended up being a review of what I had previously learned, but I did pick up new concepts, mainly being the features in ES6. The features in ES6 like arrow functions and destructuring were completely new to me when learning JavaScript. However, I did not like everything I learned, because I preferred doing things the “normal, ES5” way, like declaring a function with the “function” keyword and not using arrow functions. This is probably due to the heavy use of Java, C, and C++ in the courses leading up to ICS 314. But, ES6 did make loop iterations a little simpler, especially when iterating through strings, which is nice. Overall, I am happy with the refresher and exposure to new concepts within JavaScript. 

Compared to other languages, JavaScript is simpler. The syntax of JavaScript makes it easier to read and interpret compared to other languages like C, C++, and Java. JavaScript is also less strict with variables, since there are no type declarations. I like that JavaScript is less strict because there are less words to read and type when coding. The simplicity of JavaScript makes it a favored language for a lot of people. I would not call it my language of choice, simply for the fact that I have more experience with Java, but that may change throughout the course of ICS 314. 

All in all, I am happy that I learned more about JavaScript. Also, I was happy to have learned a lot of Java before refreshing my knowledge of JavaScript. In my opinion, learning a “stricter” language like Java helped me understand what pieces of code were doing, because code looked more specific. Transitioning from a “stricter” language to a simpler language was almost seamless except for the small syntax differences. I do not think it would be the same if it were the other way around. 

## Athletic Software Engineering: An Introduction
I find the concept of athletic software engineering very interesting, as it challenges us students to be able to efficiently develop working solutions in a pressured, time constrained environment. The practice WODs (Workouts of the day) challenged me to be more efficient with writing code, in contrast to my usual, laid back, “time is not an issue" approach that I used in previous courses and assignments. Since the practice WODs had to be approached differently, I finished them slower than I thought I would. The practice WODs essentially forced me to think and work faster, which is very applicable to the software engineering world where deadlines are tight and fast approaching. For myself personally, I would not say that this style of learning is necessarily enjoyable, but practical and beneficial. I expect to gain a lot from this style of learning.

## More Than Just Etiquette
My former professor, who taught me object-oriented programming, once shared with his class, "Writing code is supposed to tell a story." Initially, I didn't fully grasp the meaning behind his words. However, as we progressed through various programming assignments throughout the semester, his statement gradually made more sense. Coding adheres to a set of standards within the development community, enforced for everyone to follow. However, the uniqueness in each person's programming approach can occasionally clash with these standards. 

## What makes Coding Standards Standard?
Coding standards aim to help programmers set up their code in a manner that is easily readable, whether they are an expert or a beginner. This would significantly benefit working environments, particularly when multiple software engineers are collaborating on the same project. Moreover, adhering to coding standards would result in fewer errors and better maintenance for teams.

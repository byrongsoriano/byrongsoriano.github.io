## From Scratch to Frameworks
In web development, a framework is a collection of tools, libraries, conventions, and guidelines aimed at assisting application development. Typically, these frameworks the development process and foster efficiency, consistency, and code. They can also speed up development processes by providing common functionalities so developers don't have to spend extra time reconstructing them, allowing them to tidy up the front-end of the websites. 



## A Modern Experience
Before diving into frameworks, I often wondered how modern websites managed to incorporate icons like social media logos, tabs, and other functional symbols. While recreating the IslandSnow website, I gained insight into this process. Many of these sites feature a navigation bar designed using HTML and CSS files. Crafting the navigation bar proved to be an exciting yet challenging endeavor in website development.

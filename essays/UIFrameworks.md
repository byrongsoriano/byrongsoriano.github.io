## From Scratch to Frameworks
In the realm of programming and software development, a framework is a structured and pre-established set of tools, libraries, conventions, and guidelines that provide some foundation for building applications. Generally, these frameworks can simplify the development process and promote efficiency, consistency, and readability of the codebase. Basically, frameworks can significantly speed up development processes by establishing many common functionalities so developers don't have to spend time reinventing them, allowing them to focus on the specific functionality unique to their projects.

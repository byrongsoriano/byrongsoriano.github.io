## From Scratch to Frameworks
In web development, a framework is a set of tools, libraries, conventions, and guidelines that assist in developing applications. Generally, these frameworks can simplify the development process and promote efficiency, consistency, and readability of the codebase. Basically, frameworks can significantly speed up development processes by establishing many common functionalities so developers don't have to spend time reinventing them, allowing them to focus on the specific functionality unique to their projects.

## A Modern Experience
Prior to learning frameworks, I have always wondered how modern-day websites were able to implement custom icons such as social media logos, tabs, and other useful icons. When I worked on recreating the IslandSnow website, I learned how these websites were able to acheive that. Most of these websites have a useful navbar for consumers to navigate through which uses html and css files to design. I thought working on the navigation bar was a challenging but fun experience for website development.

## Javascript at a glance


Back in middle school, while playing video games with classmates in our computer lab, one of my classmates enjoyed experimenting with webpages in a number of ways. His favorite tool was the inspect element. At that time, I wasn't familiar with it, so he introduced me to it, giving me a visual exposure to the website's code. He used inspect element to change fonts and words on websites for amusement which made me think he was a hacker. He even changed his letter grades on his report card website to mislead his parents about getting good grades. However, this didn't last once the actual report cards arrived in the mail. Since then, my interest has grown, leading me to learn about programming languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
